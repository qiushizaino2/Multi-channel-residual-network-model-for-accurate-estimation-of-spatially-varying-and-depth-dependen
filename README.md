### Introduction
In this paper, we propose a novel multi-channel residual deep network model to learn the end-to-end mapping function between the in-focus and out-of-focus image patches captured at different spatial locations and depths.Besides, we construct a dataset containing well-aligned in-focus, out-of-focus and depth image.
